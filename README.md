This is a Safari extension that hides all deleted answers on <http://stackoverflow.com>.

When installed, it adds a custom stylesheet for `stackoverflow.com` and `meta.stackoverflow.com` with this content:

    div.deleted-answer {
        display: none !important;
    }

You can install the extension by double-clicking the [HideStackOverflowDeletedAnswers.safariextz](https://github.com/kristopherjohnson/HideStackOverflowDeletedAnswers/raw/master/HideStackOverflowDeletedAnswers.safariextz) file.

The source is available here so that you can further customize the CSS or include additional Stack Exchange websites.  The extension can be opened and edited with Safari's [Extension Builder](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/Tools/Conceptual/SafariExtensionGuide/UsingExtensionBuilder/UsingExtensionBuilder.html).
