This is a Safari extension that hides all deleted answers on <http://stackoverflow.com>.

When installed, it adds a custom stylesheet with this content:

    div.deleted-answer {
        display: none !important;
    }

You can install the extension by double-clicking the [HideStackOverflowDeletedAnswers.safariextz](HideStackOverflowDeletedAnswers.safariextz) file.

The source is available here so that you can further customize the CSS or include additional Stack Exchange websites.
